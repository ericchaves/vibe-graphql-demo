# Python Best Practices for GraphQL Filter Demo

This document outlines the Python best practices to be followed during the development of the GraphQL Filter Demo project.

## PEP 8 Compliance

*   Adhere to PEP 8 style guide for code formatting.
*   Use a linter (like Flake8 or Pylint) and formatter (like Black or autopep8) to ensure compliance.

## Type Hinting

*   Use type hints for function arguments, return values, and variables to improve code readability and maintainability.
*   Utilize tools like MyPy for static type checking.

## Docstrings

*   Write clear and concise docstrings for all modules, classes, methods, and functions.
*   Follow a consistent docstring format (e.g., Google, NumPy, or reST style).

## Modularity and Organization

*   Organize code into logical modules and packages.
*   Keep functions and classes small and focused on a single responsibility.

## Error Handling

*   Use exceptions for error handling.
*   Catch specific exceptions rather than broad `except Exception:` clauses.
*   Provide informative error messages.

## Naming Conventions

*   Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and modules.
*   Follow PEP 8 naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes).

## Imports

*   Organize imports at the top of the file.
*   Group imports in the following order: standard library, third-party libraries, local application/library specific imports.
*   Use absolute imports where possible.

## Testing

*   Write tests for your code (unit tests, integration tests).
*   Aim for good test coverage.
